# S&P 500 Valuation

## Project Goal:

Estimate a range of realistic values for the S&P 500. Since inputs are estimates, we will
use distributions as inputs instead of point estimates. This should better reflect the true levels of uncertainty in our final value.

## Inputs

- Current Risk Free Rate (10 year treasury yield)
- Equity Risk Premium
- Future Risk Free Rate
- Return on Equity
- Cash Flows as a Percent of Earnings Next Year
